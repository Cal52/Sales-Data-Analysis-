## Sales Data Analysis 
The data contains tables giving granular data on sales, search ranking, reviews, and so on. The task is  to analyze the data and provide answers to questions with respect to the data.

Questions 



1. Identify the most expensive SKU, on average, over the entire time period.
  
2. What % of SKUs have generated some revenue in this time period? (brownie points - can you identify SKUs that stopped selling completely after July?)

3 Somewhere in this timeframe, there was a Sale Event. Identify the dates.

4. (Dependent on 3) Does having a sale event cannibalize sales in the immediate aftermath? Highlighting a few examples would suffice 

5 . In each category, find the subcategory that has grown slowest relative to the category it is present in. If you were handling the entire portfolio, which of these subcategories would you be most concerned with?

6. Highlight any anomalies/mismatches in the data that you see, if any. (In terms of data quality issues)

7. For SKU Name C120[H:8NV, discuss whether Unit Conversion (Units/Views) is affected by Average Selling Price.
